# SalesSystem-ERacing

This is a project I worked on in my 3rd semester while studying at NAIT. I collaborated with 3 other developers and we bult the whole app together. 
I was in charge of building the Sales Subsystem, which includes the pages Sales - In Store Purchase and Sales - Refund. Here's how they work:

## In Store Purchase
- A person brings their order to the cashier who manually adds item to the cart.
- Cashier browses through the category drop down then the item drop down. They they select the quantity of item and click add.
- The item gets added to the list and all the totals are calculated. Adding the same item multiple times simply increases its quantity in the list.
- To remove an item from the list, cashier can simply click the red X button.
- Once all the items are added, the cashier clicks the Purchase button. If the transaction is successful, a message is displayed and the Invoice ID is generated.
- Clicking the Clear Cart button clears all the fields and resets the page for a new purchase.
